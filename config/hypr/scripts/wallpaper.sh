# Wallpaper picker — SUPER + W. Uses wofi so it matches the launcher.
#
# Offers two sources: your own images in ~/Pictures/wallpapers, and the
# wallpapers Hyprland ships in /usr/share/hypr (wall0-2). The system ones are
# read in place rather than copied — they are 13-27MB each, and an update to
# the hyprland package brings in whatever it ships next.
#
#     wallpaper.sh              open the picker
#     wallpaper.sh --set <path> apply one image directly
#     wallpaper.sh --random     set a random one, no menu (handy in autostart)
#     wallpaper.sh --restore    re-apply the recorded choice (install time)
#     wallpaper.sh --print      list what would be offered, one path per line
#     wallpaper.sh --no-reload  record the choice but do not put it on screen
#
# The choice is recorded in ~/.config/hypr/.active-wallpaper, and hyprlock.conf
# is rewritten from it so the lock screen matches. Both are files the installer
# syncs, so --restore is how a re-run puts your pick back after the sync.
#
# The wallpaper itself is drawn by swaybg, which takes the image as an argument
# — no daemon, no socket, nothing to wait for. It replaced hyprpaper, whose
# apply is an IPC call that answers "ok" whether or not it painted anything,
# and which on install media never answered at all.
