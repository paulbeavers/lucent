"""Input — keyboard and touchpad.

Current values come from the running compositor rather than from a file,
because the compositor is the only thing that knows what actually took effect:
input.lua is the default, settings.lua overrides it, and a device rule can
override that again.

Writing goes the other way. Rather than edit input.lua, which is hand-written
and full of comments, the page emits hypr/settings.lua — a generated module
hyprland.lua loads last. hl.config sets one key and leaves its siblings alone,
so overriding four settings does not disturb the twenty around them.

The modifier at the top of the page is the exception to both halves of that.
It is not an hl.config key, so the compositor cannot be asked for it and it
cannot go in settings.lua — keybinds.lua binds with it, and that runs before
settings.lua is loaded. It is read from and written to hypr/keys.lua instead.

Picking Alt moves the secondary modifier to Control as well. Leaving it on
Super would park thirteen binds on Command, which is the one key the host
machine this setting exists for does not pass through.
