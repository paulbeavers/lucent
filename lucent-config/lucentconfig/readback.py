"""Reading the current settings out of the files that hold them.

A settings app that opens showing defaults instead of what the machine is
actually doing is worse than useless, so every page reads the real state. Where
the running compositor knows (input, displays) we ask it; where only a file
knows (idle timeouts, the lid) we parse the file, including the hand-written
one that shipped, because the first run happens before we have written
anything of our own.
